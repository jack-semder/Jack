## Hi! I'm Jack.

I'm an emerging python devleloper with a passion for statistics, machine learning, and big data. I'm currently working as an IT administrator, in which I maintain software and automate tasks within my organization.

My interests other than software development include roadtripping/traveling, hiking, golf, and most other sports. I've been drawn to sports statistics from a young age, and hope to take my career down that road.
