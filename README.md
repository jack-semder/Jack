I'm an emerging python devleloper with passion for statistics, machine learning, and big data. I'm currently building a website in my freetime, which I plan to make active this year: jacksemder.com 

My interests other than software development include roadtripping/traveling, hiking, golf, and most other sports. I've been drawn to sports statistics from a young age, and hope to take my career down that road.
